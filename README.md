# MSCI253
Lab Sessions for my TA Job, MSCI 253 - Statistics and Probability II 


Welcome! 

This repo houses all the code (in R and sometimes maybe even Python) as well as any notes (PowerPoint, Notion, PDFs etc) for MSCI253 at University of Waterloo. This course is offered in Spring 2023 and I am one of the Teaching Assistances for the course and responsible for our Lab Sessions on Mondays at 2:30-4PM. All the code are either written from scratch by me or copied from around the web, textbooks, exercises or MOOCs. Feel free to just download the files and play around with them. Most of this course focuses heavily on Statistics, so we won't be building applications or doing Data Science projects. 

The files are organized Weekly and the material covered follows what is stated on the Syllabus + some additional stuff if we have the time based on the stuff you learned in class the previous week.
